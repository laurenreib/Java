# Design of Large Programming Project Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of academic and personal programming projects. These projects demonstrate my experience with game logic, multithreading, system simulations, and networked applications. Each project was built using JavaFx and showcases both foundational and advanced computer science concepts.

## NYTimes Tiles Game Replica
A recreation of the New York Times "Tiles" puzzle game.

- Replicated core matching and scoring logic
- Implemented a responsive GUI with dynamic tile interaction
- Emphasized clean design and intuitive user experience

---

## Dominos Game with Bot Player
A complete game of Dominos featuring human vs. bot gameplay.

- Valid move logic and score tracking implemented
- Bot designed with strategic decision-making logic
- Reinforced object-oriented design and game state management
- Extra Dominos placed in the BoneYard

## Scrabble
A single version of the classic word game.

- Supports tile placement, word validation, and real-time scoring
- Utilizes a dictionary file for legal word checking
- Efficient data structures for board and hand management

---

## Multithreaded Fire Simulation
A simulation of wildfire spread through a network of sensor nodes.

- Fire spreads across nodes using multithreaded logic
- Includes a base station and mobile agents for monitoring
- Base station burns when fire reaches it â€” full system collapse is possible
- Threads used to model fire propagation, agent movement, and sensor updates

## Distributed Auction System with Bank & Mobile Agent
A networked client-server system simulating a competitive online auction environment.

- Users can bid on items hosted by an auction house
- System includes:
  - Central **Bank** to manage user balances and transfers
  - Multiple **Auction Houses** selling items concurrently
  - Mobile **AutoAgent** that places bids autonomously
- Supports:
  - Multithreaded client-server communication
  - Competing users and agents in real-time auctions
  - Secure fund handling and item tracking
  - Uses a hardcoded host and ports (bank & auction) to join the auction (localhost : 1245 : 6666)
